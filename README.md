# Fruit-Classifier
Decision Tree Classifier to identify 3 fruits: mango, plum and cherry from the dataset

## Concepts
1. Decision Tree Learning Algorithm:<br>
CART (Classification And Regression Tree) is the algorithm used for Decision Tree Learning.

2. Gini Impurity: is used to quantify the uncertainity at a single node<br>
It tells about the chances of being incorrect.

3. Information Gain: is used to quantify how much a question reduces the uncertainity

4. Utility Functions: are used to determine the values in an efficient way.

##  Future Plan
Try the decision tree on multiple inputs (fruit type) and with more features.
Implement decision tree on different use cases like identifying wine types, chocolates, etc
